In this repository, I undertake a series of business analytics projects

## Online Retail
In a series of notebooks I carry out Business Analytics for a UK-based online retailer. The retailer is a non-store small business that was registered in 1981 and operated mainly through catalogue mails and over-the-phone orders. They opened their first website in 2009(Chen, Sain and Guo, 2012). The retailer mainly sells to wholesalers. The transactions dataset is available for a 2-year period from December 2009 to December 2011.
